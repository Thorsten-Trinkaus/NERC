# NERC of Different Granularities

Course project for **Formale Semantik** (University of Heidelberg).
We investigate **Named Entity Recognition & Classification (NERC)** under **increasing label granularity** (from coarse-grained up to ultra-fine entity typing).

> Status: Work in progress (this repo will evolve as experiments and structure solidify!).
